Example:
If you choose 3 keys, the text will be encrypted 3 times, once for each key.

Here’s the process:

1. The original text is encrypted with Key 1.


2. The resulting encrypted text is then encrypted again with Key 2.


3. The output from the second encryption is encrypted a third time with Key 3.



This creates a multi-layer encryption where all 3 keys are required in reverse order (Key 3, Key 2, then Key 1) to decrypt the text successfully.
