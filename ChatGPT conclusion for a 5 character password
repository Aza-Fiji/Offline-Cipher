Conclusion:
It would take approximately 243 years 
to brute-force a 5-character password 
with AES-256, PBKDF2 with 
1 million iterations, 
and a 128-byte salt, 
assuming 1 second per guess 
with a character set that includes 
lowercase, uppercase, digits, and symbols.
(1 guess per second due to the 1 million iterations)

Conclusion:
With the given encryption setup (AES-256 + PBKDF2 with 1 million iterations and a 128-byte salt), cracking the encryption is practically impossible, even for a supercomputer like Frontier. The combination of AES-256's key space, PBKDF2's computational overhead, and the massive salt size makes this setup highly resistant to attacks.

Without knowing the password or having some additional vulnerability to exploit (like poor password choice or implementation flaws), no supercomputer—including the cutting-edge Frontier—can break the encryption within a feasible amount of time. Even with immense computational resources, brute-forcing AES-256 encryption with a strong password is beyond our current and foreseeable technological capabilities.
